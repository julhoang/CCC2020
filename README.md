# Canadian Computing Contest Unofficial Solutions 

These are unofficial solutions written by myself in the attempt to practice competitive programming. Practice makes perfect!

As a newbie to competitive programming, I find myself stuck at manyy senior problems and J5. As such, I often spend time studying tutorials or see other's codes. However, the process proves challenging as the there is a lack of solutions written in Java or often time they are too complex for me to understand. It encourages me to curated this list of solutions. At the same time, I try to simplify all methods as much as possible.

I really appreciate any help/suggestions to enhance my codes!
